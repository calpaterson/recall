Recall
======

About
-----
Recall is a program for storing "bookmarks" of different kinds of
things.  A bookmark ("mark") could be of a place, universal resource
locator, comment, person, etc.  The format has been deliberately kept
as extensible as possible.

The program
-----------
The program mainly consists of a server and a javascript web program.
There is also a client for sending messages to the server, though it
is mostly for development use.

Running the server
------------------
Dependancies:
    - mongodb
    - pymongo
    - python flask

First, configure server/config.json.  Ensure mongodb is running and
then run server.py

Running the javascript web program
----------------------------------
First, configure www/config.js.  Using a webserver (such as nginx or
apache), add the contents of the www/ directory somewhere in the
webservers' document root, and then open the index.html file.
